String-MFN

This module provides an mechanism for normalizing a string, which
briefly means converting the string to something which resembles a
sane UNIX filename containing no special characters, while attempting
to maintain information carried by the original formatting.

Also included is a script, mfn, which recursively renames files to a
nice UNIX-y standard format.
